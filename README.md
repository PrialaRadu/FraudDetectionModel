# Fraud Detection | XGBOOST MODEL

A machine learning model that detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.

I used a dataset from Kaggle, which contains 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are labeled as fraud.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data

After building and tuning our model using XGBOOST and RandomizedSearchCV, I evaluated its performance using various metrics, including precision, recall and F1-score."
